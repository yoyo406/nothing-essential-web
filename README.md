# EssentialSpaceWeb

> A privacy-focused, local-first notespace inspired by the "Essential" design philosophy of Nothing OS.

**EssentialSpaceWeb** is a minimalist web application designed to help you organize your thoughts, tasks, and memories without distractions. Built with a unique "Dot Matrix" aesthetic, it offers a clutter-free environment that mimics the Essential Space feature found on Nothing phones, but right in your browser.

## ✨ Features

*   **Privacy First**: All data is stored locally on your device using IndexedDB. No data is ever sent to the cloud.
*   **Versatile Note Types**: Create various types of entries to suit your needs:
    *   `[NOTE]`: Standard text notes.
    *   `[PHOTO]`: Save memories with images.
    *   `[EVENT]`: Track upcoming events with dates and times.
    *   `[IDEA]`: Capture fleeting thoughts.
    *   `[TASK]`: Manage your to-do list.
*   **Smart Widgets**:
    *   **Recent**: Instantly view your most recent media capture.
    *   **Upcoming**: Always see your next scheduled event at a glance.
*   **Organization**:
    *   **Tagging**: Organize entries with custom tags.
    *   **Pinning**: Keep important notes at the top of your list.
    *   **Filtering**: Easily filter your view by tags to focus on what matters.
*   **Responsive Design**: A fluid layout that adapts to different screen sizes while maintaining its distinctive look.
