# EssentialSpaceWeb

> A privacy-focused, local-first notespace inspired by the "Essential" design philosophy of Nothing OS.

**EssentialSpaceWeb** is a minimalist web application designed to help you organize your thoughts, tasks, and memories without distractions. Built with a unique "Dot Matrix" aesthetic, it offers a clutter-free environment that mimics the Essential Space feature found on Nothing phones, but right in your browser.

## ✨ Features
